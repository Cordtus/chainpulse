# Chain Pulse

Collect packets relayed to and from a given blockchain, computing which packets are effected or not and by whom they were relayed.

The collected data is stored in a SQLite database and the metrics are exported to Prometheus.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/informalsystems/chainpulse
   ```

2. Build the `chainpulse` executable
   ```shell
   $ cargo build --release
   ```

3. The `chainpulse` executable can now be found in `target/release`

## Usage

```
Collect and analyze txs containing IBC messages, export metrics for Prometheus

Usage: chainpulse [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --ws <WS_URL>     Tendermint WebSocket URL [default: wss://rpc.osmosis.zone/websocket]
      --db <DB_PATH>    Path to the SQLite database file, will be created if not existing [default: osmosis.db]
      --metrics <PORT>  Port on which to serve the Prometheus metrics, at `http://0.0.0.0:PORT/metrics`.
                        If not set, then the metrics won't be served
  -h, --help            Print help
```

To collect metrics for Osmosis and serve those at `http://localhost:3000/metrics`, run the following command:

```
$ chainpulse -- --ws wss://rpc.osmosis.zone/websocket --db osmosis.db --metrics 3000
```

## Metrics

- `ibc_effected_packets{chain_id, src_channel, src_port, dst_channel, dst_port, signer, memo}`
- `ibc_uneffected_packets{chain_id, src_channel, src_port, dst_channel, dst_port, signer, memo}`
- `ibc_frontrun_counter{chain_id, src_channel, src_port, dst_channel, dst_port, signer, frontrunned_by, memo, effected_memo}`
